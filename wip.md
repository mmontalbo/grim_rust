# Work in Progress

## Current Direction
- Pivoted away from patching the original executable; the repository now
  documents the shipping boot flow and builds a Rust analysis toolchain that can
  reason about the Lua sources directly.
- Decomposed legacy Lua quirks so `full_moon` can parse every decompiled file
  without fallback string hacks.

## Active Threads
- `grim_analysis` parses `_system`, `_sets`, and every room script, building an
  aggregate of set hooks and the actors they spawn.
- Static simulator groups stateful calls by subsystem (objects, inventory,
  interest actors, actors, audio, progression) so we can see which engine
  services the Lua scripts expect.
- JSON report (`--json-report`) persists hook simulations plus any unclassified
  method calls, helping us track coverage gaps over time.
- Registry shim reads/writes JSON snapshots so repeated runs mimic the original
  engine's registry mutations (e.g., `GrimLastSet`).

## Next Steps
1. Keep widening the legacy normalisation pass (additional helper keywords,
   comment forms) so parsing never regresses.
2. Add unit tests that exercise the simulator on tricky hooks (mixed method
   chains, nested tables) to lock in behaviour.
3. Sketch the services a Rust host will need—script scheduler, cutscene
   playback, save/load—before we begin porting logic out of Lua.
