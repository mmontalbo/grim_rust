# Work in Progress (migrated)

The canonical work-in-progress log now lives inside the executable `./wip` script.
Run `./wip status` to view the latest plan, or `./wip --help` for additional commands such as
`./wip continue`, `./wip review`, and `./wip iterate`.
Structured sections and workstream prompts live in `wip_state.json`; edit that file to update the plan.
